I hope everyone is doing fine during these trying times. I have somewhat enjoyed being at home, but I miss being in Chapel Hill. I have not done any kind of coding in a very long time, so I apologize if my page does not hold a high standard. Anyways, I hope everyone can actually see this and stay safe!
